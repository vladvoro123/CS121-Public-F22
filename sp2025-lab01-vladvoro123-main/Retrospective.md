# Retrospective

- name: TODO

## Instructions

Employers consistently look for people who can clearly and correctly
talk about their work; this is your chance to practice explaining your
processes and your code.

For the **Experience** and **Lab Questions** sections, answer the
questions using complete sentences and proper grammar.  Not all labs
will have a **Lab Questions** section.

For the **Known issues or Bugs** section you need to detail any issues
or bugs that you have in your code. For example maybe your code
crashes randomly and you couldn't figure out why. If your code doesn't
have any issues you can simply write NONE in this section.

For the **Sources used** section you must detail any sources you used
and *how you used them* outside of the textbook or course
website. Please include any tutorials you used as well.  This helps me
figure out what areas need more explanation.  If you write NONE in
this section it is assumed that you didn't use any outside resources
at all.  Be safe CITE!

## Experience

TODO

- Were there any parts of the lab that you felt were unclear? If so,
  why? What would have made it clearer?

- State two or three specific skills or concepts you felt this lab
  helped you learn or understand. (You can list these in incomplete
  sentences.)

- What was your biggest challenge in this lab? Explain your challenge
  specifically - what method, what concept, etc.
