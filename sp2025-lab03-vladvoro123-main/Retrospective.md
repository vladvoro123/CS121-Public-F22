# Retrospective

- name: Vlad Vorozhko

## Instructions

Employers consistently look for people who can clearly and correctly
talk about their work; this is your chance to practice explaining your
processes and your code.

For the **Experience** and **Lab Questions** sections, answer the
questions using complete sentences and proper grammar.  Not all labs
will have a **Lab Questions** section.

For the **Known issues or Bugs** section you need to detail any issues
or bugs that you have in your code. For example maybe your code
crashes randomly and you couldn't figure out why. If your code doesn't
have any issues you can simply write NONE in this section.

For the **Sources used** section you must detail any sources you used
and *how you used them* outside of the textbook or course
website. Please include any tutorials you used as well.  This helps me
figure out what areas need more explanation.  If you write NONE in
this section it is assumed that you didn't use any outside resources
at all.  Be safe CITE!

## Experience

TODO

- Were there any parts of the lab that you felt were unclear? If so,
  why? What would have made it clearer?

  It was all pretty clear and once you understood all the different files and 
  how they are connected the assignment made sense. One thing I misread or 
  brushed over is the commits. Sometimes I get ahead of myself and forget to 
  submit when it says to and try to finish as much as possible before taking
  a break. So I completed the entire assignment then submitted everything. 

- State two or three specific skills or concepts you felt this lab
  helped you learn or understand. (You can list these in incomplete
  sentences.)

  In this lab I learned about the super class and how to utilize it properly. Another thing
  I learned is the importance of breaking your code up into sections. I tried to make it 
  more efficient by not creating my variables and including them in the new floorticket 
  right away and this caused me lots of problems. Luckily when I broke it apart I realized my
  mistake and did it correctly the next time around. 

- What was your biggest challenge in this lab? Explain your challenge
  specifically - what method, what concept, etc.

My biggest challenge in this lab was understanding the connection between all the different 
files. Such as the ticket class and the tester along with the baskit ticket and ticket
interface. 

## Lab Questions
TODO

1. What's the difference between an interface and an abstract class?
An abstract class can be shared by multiple classes such as the extend one
that was used in this lab. However an interface is only defining one class.

2. Why were both used in this lab?
An abstract class was used for the basic ticket class which extended to 
stageticket, floorticket, and vipticket. The testers however used the 
common interface class.

3. What is specifically NOT inherited by a child (derived) class from
   the parent (base) class?
One thing that is not inherited by a child class from the parent class is the
constructors.
